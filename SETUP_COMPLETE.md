## 🚀 How to View

### Option 1: Direct File Open
Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended)
For best results, use a local server:

**Python:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit: `http://localhost:8000`

**Node.js:**
```bash
npm start
```
Then visit: `http://localhost:3000`

**VS Code:**
- Install "Live Server" extension
- Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"

## 📝 Notes

1. **Animations**: All CSS animations and JavaScript interactions are preserved
2. **Responsiveness**: Test at different viewport sizes (375px, 768px, 1920px)
3. **Fonts**: Fonts are loaded from the original Webflow CDN. If you want local fonts, download them separately
4. **External Links**: Some links point to external pages (about-us, projects, etc.) which won't work locally
5. **Forms**: Contact forms may require backend setup to function

## 🔧 Customization

- **Colors**: Edit `styles.css` to change color scheme
- **Content**: Edit `index.html` to modify text and structure
- **Images**: Replace files in `assets/` folder
